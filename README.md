# Autonomous Labyrinth Navigation

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of `RobotC programming` to autonomously navigate a robot through a labyrinth course. The robot utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect walls and obstacles, allowing it to move forward until a wall is sensed within a specified threshold distance. The program includes functions for moving forward, turning left, and turning right, which are sequenced to navigate the maze. The code is configured for the `RVW SQUAREBOT model`.
