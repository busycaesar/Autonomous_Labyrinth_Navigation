# Labyrinth Course Robotc

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of RobotC programming to autonomously navigate a robot through a labyrinth course. The robot utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect walls and obstacles, allowing it to move forward until a wall is sensed within a specified threshold distance. The program includes functions for moving forward, turning left, and turning right, which are sequenced to navigate the maze. The code is configured for the RVW SQUAREBOT model.
